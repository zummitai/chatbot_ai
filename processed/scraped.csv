Please note that we would not be held liable for refunding any expense incurred without prior agreement that shall be validated by the Assistance company through a file number.

Can I wait until I return to file a claim?

Please remember to keep the original invoices of any expenses you incurred in, as they will be requested together with other necessary documents. Please send a mail along with all the documents via email to servicemedical.ame@axa-assistance.ma while putting insure@axamansard.com in copy of your mails
